Shared documentation lives in `docs/`. When deciding where processing should run (client JS, Web APIs, Wasm, or server-side), refer to the client-first/serverless priority order in [Project Principles §9](./docs/principles.md#9-client-vs-server-processing-priorities) so humans and agents follow the same policy.
